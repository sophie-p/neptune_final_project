# Neptune Computational Biology - Final Project

## Guidelines - you can delete this section before submission

This repository is a stub for your final project. Fork it, develop your project, and submit it as a pull request. Edit/ delete the text in this readme as needed.

Some guidelines and tips:

- Use the stubs below to write up your final project.

- For information on formatting text files with markdown, see https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/ . You can use markdown to include images in this document by linking to files in the repository, eg `![Figure 1](./Figure1.png?raw=true)`.

- The project must be entirely reproducible. In addition to the results, the repository must include all the data (or links to data) and code needed to reproduce the results.

- If you are working with unpublished data that you would prefer not to publicly share at this time, please contact me to discuss options. In most cases, the data can be anonymized in a way that putting them in a public repo does not compromise your other goals.

- Paste references (including urls) into the reference section, and cite them with the general format (Smith at al. 2003).

- Commit and push often as you work.

OK, here we go.

# Tropomyosin characterisation in a cnidarian

## Introduction and Goals

I would like to identify the Tropomyosin genes in the genome of a cnidarian, build a phylogeny of the tropomyosin of cnidarians and see whether the tropomyosin expression varies along the life cycle.

The methods I will use to do this are...

The data I will use are genome and transcriptome data not yet published. 

## Methods

The tools I used were... See analysis files at (links to analysis files).

## Results

In Figure 1...

## Discussion

These results indicate...

The biggest difficulty in implementing these analyses was...

If I did these analyses again, I would...
